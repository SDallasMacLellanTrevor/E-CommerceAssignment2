// Immutable
// as an option since the request represents external data that we don't need to change in our application
// we can make its objects as immutable:
// 1- Set the properties as private
// 2- only set the properties using the contructor
// 3- don't create setters 
// this way once the object is created the values cannot be changed
// this is also useful in multithreading applications to guarantee that the same data
// is used by all threads and it doesn't get changed in one of the threads.
